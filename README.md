Stripe POC with NojdeJS

# Configure project

Create a .env file in the project root (same level than package.json), and add the environment variabled. To see all variables take a look at the file **src/config.js**.
Example for local:
```
PROTOCOL=http
HOST=localhost
PORT=3000
STRIPE_SECRET=generate_a_secret
```

Go to **src/views/product.hbs** and configure the Price ID inside the form. The value is generated by Stripe.

# Start project

If your first time run:
```
npm install
```

To start run:
```
node src/index.js
```
